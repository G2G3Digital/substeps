Substeps
=======

Welcome to Substeps!  Project documentation can be found [here](http://technophobia.github.com/substeps/ "Substeps documentation").  

Project documentation is generated using Sphinx and at present we use Sphinx rst extensions, sadly github doesn't recognise some of these extensions so viewing the rst files directly doesn't always work out as intended

There is also a [Substeps Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/substeps?hl=en-GB "Substeps Google group") if you have any queries and where new releases will ne announced.
