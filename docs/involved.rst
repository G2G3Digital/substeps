The Future
----------

We're not done yet!! :-)

We've got a number of ideas and plans to enhance both the core capabilities of substeps and to add
 to the libraries of step implementations.
 
Future plans include:
- More webdriver substeps
- Database and Email related susbtep libraries
- Better looking / functional reports
- More functionality in the eclipse plugin
- a maven archetype
- Colour output on the command line (for shells that support it)
- and many more....
